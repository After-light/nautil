## What is all the Nautil?

Nautil\[ˈnɔːtɪl] is a modern javascript frontend framework which helps you to build enterprise level business system by using familiar React syntax.

The purpose of Nautil is to make complex business system development more systematic, easy and efficient.

Nautil is built on React and is a framework, not a UI library. Developers can use React components in Nautil applications directly as possible. *Nautil is absolutely React, however, Nautil is more than React.* As a framework, it provides MVC architecture, router, state management, model management, event stream management, internationalization and ability of cross-platform.

Without importing all the ecosystem of React, without complex redux, without any more choice of third part libraries, you will begin and build your application quickly with Nautil. Feel happy and relaxing when you writing with Nautil. It will work as what you think. You do not need to learn more than react. The only thing you need to know is some feature level api. There is no syntax level or higher knowledge to learn. Try it, I belive, you will fall in love with Nautil in 5 minutes.
