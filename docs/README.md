## What is all the Nuatil?

Nautil (nautil.js) is a javascript frontend framework based on *React*. You can use it to build business applications quickly by using familiar React syntax.

The purpose of Nautil is to make development more easy, quick and systematic.

Nautil is built on React, but is is a framework, not a UI library.
