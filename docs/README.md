# Nautil

> May be the fastest javascript framework to build cross-platform applications.

## What is all the Nuatil?

Nautil (nautil.js) is a javascript frontend framework. You can use it to build cross-platform applications very fast by using familiar React syntax.

The purpose of Nautil is to make development more easy, quick and comfortable.

Nautil is built on React, but is is a framework, not a UI library. Developers can use React components in Nautil applications directly as possible. *Nautil is absolutely React, however, Nautil is more than React.* As a framework, it provides router/navigation, state management, model management, event management, internationalization and ability of cross-platform.
