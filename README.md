<div  align="center">Nautil is a responsive, efficient, and flexible JavaScript framework for building cross-platform applications.</div>

## Overview

Nautil is built on React and is a framework not only a UI library. Developers can use React components in Nautil applications directly as possible. *Nautil is absolutely React, however, Nautil is more than React.* As a framework, it provides router/navigation, state management, data management, event stream, internationalization and ability of cross-platform.

Nautil is following *Observer Pattern*. In the development, you will find that you should often think about how to use Observer Pattern to trigger UI update. However, don't worry about it, it is easy.

To have a taste quickly, run with:

```
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
npx nautil-cli init
npm run dev
```
